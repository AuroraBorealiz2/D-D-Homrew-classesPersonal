        "description": "Beginning at 1st level, you can force any creature to roll a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC as an action. If they fail, you establish a magical link between them and yourself. If the creature is charmed by you, or under someone’s control such as with Command, or Suggestion, they roll with disadvantage. Once this link is established, you may use a subsequent bonus action to compel the creature to: \n- Make an Attack against a creature in its range. \n- Move up to its movement speed in any direction. \n- Speak up to 50 words. \n- Use an item in its hands. \nThe link instantaneously ends if your command is directly harmful to it, if you fall unconscious, lose line of sight with the creature, choose to end it, or if you establish a link with another creature. The command is unaffected by language. \nThe first command costs nothing, the second command costs 1 Sorcery Point, and every subsequent command costs the previous amount of points +1. You do not need to issue a command every turn, and the cost of a command resets whenever your link to a creature is broken. \nStarting at 9th level, you are able to issue as many commands as you’d like per turn, as opposed to the previous singular one, so long as you have sufficient Sorcery Points."

Once you have established a link with a foe, you may cast spells from that foe’s body at no additional cost. Self Targeting spells such as Blade Ward affect the linked foe rather than yourself, and spells with a range such as firebolt are based on the foe’s position rather than your own. Additionally, when a spell cast in this method results in a killing blow you regain Sorcery Points equal to the level of the spell cast."

As an action you may expend a spell slot to attempt to override a creature’s mind. Said creature must roll a wisdom saving throw to resist it, though if the spell slot used is above level 5 the creature rolls both wisdom and charisma saving throws while using the lower result. Should the saving throw fail, they are deigned to serve you for a number of rounds equal to the level of spell slot expended. While their mind is overridden, they can take an up to 10 word task from you and will attempt to complete it to the best of their ability until their servitude ends or they die. This command must be verbal, cannot be sent over magical means such as Sending, and must be from your own body rather than someone you are linked to. Creatures you override with this feature are subject to the effects of your Arcane Relay."

This ability fails in anti-magic, silence, or when an included creature is incapacitated."
